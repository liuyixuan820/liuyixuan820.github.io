Born on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulangyu">Gulang Island</a> in 1998, I was immersed in music from childhood. I’ve learned to play the cello since the age of 4. Professor <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%8B%8F%E5%8A%9B/20348800">SU Li (苏力)</a> at Xiamen University enlightened me to the world of cello and tutored me for several years. Later, I was tutored by Professor <a href="https://mdc.hqu.edu.cn/info/1037/2570.htm">WANG Miao (王淼)</a> at Huaqiao University. During my 6 years of primary education at <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8E%A6%E9%97%A8%E5%B8%82%E9%9F%B3%E4%B9%90%E5%AD%A6%E6%A0%A1/3637157">Xiamen Music School</a>, I've won many awards at cello competitions, including:

<ul>
   <li><i>The Third Prize</i> at the 2nd Ai Qin Bei National Cello Competition (第二届全国爱琴杯大提琴比赛独奏组三等奖), Beijing, China, 2006;</li>
   <li><i>The Excellence Award</i> & <i>The Best Performance Award</i> at the 6th Asia Future Stars Music Competition (第六届亚洲明日之星音乐大赛优秀奖、最佳作品表演奖), Singapore, 2007.</li>
</ul>

Growing up, I have been a member of numerous orchestras, including:

Together, we won the <i>First Prize</i> at the 4th National Primary and Middle School Students' Music Competition (全国第四届中小学生艺术展演器乐中学甲组一等奖);</li>

I favor the Baroque period music, and my favorite composers are J.S. Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi. I've also learned to play the piano in primary school. Here you can watch a video of me playing the piano and the cello as a kid in the Gulang Island Concert Hall.

I exercise on a daily basis b/c I'm too prone to growing fat (I used to weigh roughly 250 pounds, and I lost 70 pounds of that in high school). I also enjoy playing golf in my free time. I'm coached by the pro golfer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/paul.podraza.1/">Paul Podraza</a> in Austin, TX.
