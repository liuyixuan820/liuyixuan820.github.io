If we had a presentation that we needed her opinion on, she was always available. If you told her if she could move your presentation to another date she would change it for you. She also was a great teacher. For her lectures, she always tried to include examples and activities to help her students. Overall, I feel like this course will be tremendously helpful in the future, and it's thanks to Professor Liu."</em></strong></blockquote>
